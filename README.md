# Arvo-A.I.-Technical-interview
Create a NLP model, to interactively deploy app to cloud

Furthur Improvements:
1. modify the runme.ps1 script to show effect for AWS and GSP
2. currently the script is using hard coded file path, we can modify it ot apply for github repos
3. when executed the script takes strings like flask, azure and uses if condifiton to identity the basic cloud infra needed, we can update it to support additional use cases.
